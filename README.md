### Hello there, I'm Kevin ðŸ‘‹

- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning cyber security at BINUS Universtiy, will graduate on 2022
  - I like to participate in CTFs, hacking around at hackthebox ([my profile](https://www.hackthebox.eu/home/users/profile/90510)), tryhackme ([my profile](https://tryhackme.com/p/doubleu)), and also wargames.
